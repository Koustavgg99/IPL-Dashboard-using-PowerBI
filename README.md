# IPL Dashboard using PowerBI

Created a interactive IPL dashboard using PowerBI , used parameterized charts , parameters and
created simple to complex DAX. 

## Lessons Learned from this project

### Challenges and Solutions in Building this project

## 1. Data Cleaning: ##
**Challenge:** The initial dataset had issues like missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect data formats, making it hard to ensure accurate analysis.

**Solution:** I used Power BI's data transformation tools to clean the dataset. I handled missing values by either imputing or removing them, identified and eliminated duplicates, and standardized data formats for consistency.

## 2. Data Integration: ##
**Challenge:** Integrating data from multiple sources, such as player statistics, match results, and team performance, was challenging due to different data structures and formats.

**Solution:** I leveraged Power BI's data modeling features to merge datasets accurately. By establishing relationships between tables using common keys and aligning data structures, I ensured seamless integration and comprehensive analysis across various dimensions.




## Tech Stack


1. **Power BI Desktop**: For designing the dashboard.
2. **Power BI Service**: For publishing and sharing.
3. **Data Sources**: SQL databases, Excel/CSV files.
4. **Data Connectivity Tools**: Power Query and DAX.
5. **Data Visualization**: Charts, tables, matrices, and maps.
6. **Database Management**: MySQL.
